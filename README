Build:
$ make

Installation:
# make install
(the default DESTDIR is /usr/local)

By default, no plugins are compiled, but their source files are stored in /usr/[local/]src/luminescence/plugins.

The luminescence-install script takes C plugin files, compiles them, and puts the compiled plugins in ~/.luminescence/plugins.

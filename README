INSTALLING

  For Arch Linux users:
  AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57930

  From Source:
    make
    make install
  (the default DESTDIR is /usr/local)

PLUGINS

  Plugins are read in alphabetical order (it does matter) from ~/.luminescence/plugins.

  By default, no plugins are compiled.
  Instead, their source files are stored in /usr/[local/]src/luminescence/plugins.

  The luminescence-install script takes C plugin files and installs them.
  For example, to install all the available plugins:
    luminescence-install /usr/src/luminescence/plugins/*.c

COMMANDS

  You can list the available commands with:
    luminescence --help

  To execute commands from the command line:
    luminescence --scripts off --user-agent Luminescence

CONFIGURATION (exec.c)

  The default configuration file is stored in ~/.luminescence/config:
    # Sample configuration file
    user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 Luminescence"
    scripts off
    uri http://foo/homepage

  Alternatively, you can configure Luminescence directly from C. Have a look at luminescence.h.

KEY BINDINGS (bind.c)

  You'll want to set up key bindings. The command is 'bind'.
  For example, you can write into ~/.luminescence/config:
    bind i insert-mode
    bind u uri-edit
    bind r reload
    bind j scripts off
    bind J scripts on
    bind / find

ALIASES (alias.c)

  You may want to hide the URI label when editing the URI.
  All you have to do is run:
    on uri-edit uri-hide

INSTALLING

  For Arch Linux users:
  AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57930

  From Source:
    make
    make install
  (the default DESTDIR is /usr/local)

PLUGINS

  Plugins are read in alphabetical order (it does matter) from ~/.luminescence/plugins.

  By default, no plugins are compiled.
  Instead, their source files are stored in /usr/[local/]src/luminescence/plugins.

  The luminescence-install script takes C plugin files and installs them.
  For example, to install all the available plugins:
    luminescence-install /usr/src/luminescence/plugins/*.c

OPTIONS

  You can list the available options with:
    luminescence --help

  The configuration is stored in ~/.luminescence/config:
    # Sample configuration file
    no-scripts
    user-agent Luminescence

  Alternatively, you can set the options from the command line:
    luminescence --no-scripts --user-agent Luminescence

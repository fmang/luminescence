INSTALLING

  For Arch Linux users:
  AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57930

  From Source:
    make
    make install
  (the default DESTDIR is /usr/local)

PLUGINS

  Plugins are read in alphabetical order (it does matter) from ~/.luminescence/plugins.

  By default, no plugins are compiled, but their source files are stored in /usr/[local/]src/luminescence/plugins.

  The luminescence-install script takes C plugin files and installs them.
  For example, to install all the available plugins:
    luminescence-install /usr/src/luminescence/plugins/*.c

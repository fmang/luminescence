INSTALLING

  For Arch Linux users:
  AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=57930

  From Source:
    make
    make install
  (the default DESTDIR is /usr/local)

PLUGINS

  Plugins are read in alphabetical order (it does matter) from ~/.luminescence/plugins.

  By default, no plugins are compiled.
  Instead, their source files are stored in /usr/[local/]src/luminescence/plugins.

  The luminescence-install script takes C plugin files and installs them.
  For example, to install all the available plugins:
    luminescence-install /usr/src/luminescence/plugins/*.c

COMMANDS

  You can list the available commands with:
    luminescence --help

  To execute commands from the command line:
    luminescence --scripts off --user-agent Luminescence

CONFIGURATION

  This requires the exec.c plugin.

  The default configuration file is stored in ~/.luminescence/config:
    # Sample configuration file
    user-agent Luminescence
    scripts off
    uri http://foo/homepage

KEY BINDINGS

  This requires the exec.c plugin.

  You'll want to set up key bindings.
  For example, you can write into ~/.luminescence/keys:
    # Sample keys file
    i insert-mode
    o uri-hide
    o uri-edit
    r reload

  To load it, append into ~/.luminescence/config:
    key-bindings keys
